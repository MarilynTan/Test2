And depending on the type of plank you try, you can also engage your back, arms, shoulders, glutes, and hamstrings.",

Most beneficial when you perform them slowly. Swinging your legs back and forth creates momentum rather than working the focus muscle groups, so avoid swinging. Also, follow the leg raises in your abdominal and core workout with exercises that work the opposing muscle group -- the lower back specifically -- and stretch before moving to the next part of your workout.",
